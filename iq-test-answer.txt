1. 2 (As the pattern on the upper-left, upper- right, and lower-left corner's you will see the striking relevance that they need to match the shape pointing at the center.)

2. 2 (The pattern is a growing shape from small "left" to big "right")

3. 3 (I pick this answer for the relevance to the circle shape and the outcome for it the on the intersection of the 2 square on the lower right corner)

4. 4 (Saw this a whole perspectivity of the whole diagram you will see the 3 white circle on the corner of the upper right, upper left and bottom left while the black circle are on the center as to why I pick this answer as it will be appropriate to the positioning also of the squares)

5. 3 (I based my answer on the going upward of the black circle. Why 3, not 2 well for that is the placement of the white square as you will check the alignment of this is perfectly lining up from left to right perspective)
